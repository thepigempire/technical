<p>How to install our Opera GX mod?</p>
We have made our own to make the feel of thepigempire come to your browser.<br>
<p>THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU ARE USING THE OPERA GX BROWSER WITH A VERSION THAT SUPPORTS MODDING.</p><br> 
To add the extension, click 
<a href="https://thepigempire.github.io/technical/operagxmod.crx">here</a><br>
<p>It should automatically add the extension to your browser and everything should change. To customize what gets changed, go to <a href="opera://mods">opera://mods</a> and choose what you want changed. If it did not change automatically:</p><br>
Then go to <a href="opera://extensions">opera://extensions</a> and drag and drop the file from your downloads into the opera://extensions window.<br>
If everything worked, you should instantly see your browsers theme changed.<br>
To configure what The Pig Empire changes about your browser, go to <a href="opera://mods">opera://mods</a> and toggle on/off what the mod changes. The current available changes are Theme, Wallpaper, and Background Music.
