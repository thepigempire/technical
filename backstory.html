      <p>On Tuesday, August 8, 2023, 9:00 AM (EST), The Pig Empire server was created.</p>
      <h1>How did the pig empire start?</h1>
      <p>Firstly, The Pig Empire was actually just a small part of another server we will refer to as "crafting table". The owner of the Pig Empire (which we will refer to as "TPEO") was the Co-Owner of the crafting table server. The owner once killed a pig on crafting table. TPEO saw that and was sad. After a day of talking between TPEO and the owner of crafting table, the owner of crafting table agreed to ban killing pigs.</p>
      <p>It was a month after the new rules applied to crafting table. The owner of crafting table was hosting an event, a pig race (whoever gets to the end of the course while riding their pig wins). 2 players participated, TPEO and a player named Blaze_wolf11 (9963f8a4-a04b-46ea-a9c5-eba8bd74c1e9). TPEO's wifi cut out and he was disconnected. Moments later, after TPEO's wifi was fixed, TPEO logged back onto crafting table and saw himself in a position with 2 things hanging from fences, a chest boat full of diamonds, and the pig he used for the event.</p>
      <p>The owner of crafting table asked TPEO, "Save your prize or the pig", TPEO answered the pig, and in the process of the owner of crafting table releasing the pig to TPEO, TPEO saw the pig burn in the lava (which was part of the course). Again, TPEO's wifi cut out and moments later, he was re-considering rejoining crafting table after he had just seen his new pet burn in lava.</p>
      <p>The owner of crafting table said "That wasn't your real pig! That was a fake one!" TPEO rejoined. The owner of crafting table said, "It's a joke! Your real pig is here" and revealed the "real pig" (real pig is in quotes because TPEO was soon to find out it wasn't). TPEO was suspicious so he did a quick check. Since it is a Spigot server, he did a /data check and looked for the SpigotTicksLived tag and saw it was pretty low (meaning the pig was spawned recently). TPEO called the owner of crafting table out and sent a screenshot of the /data results. TPEO, angrily, left the server. Stating in the discord server of crafting table "I quit."</p>
      <p>The owner of crafting table DM'd TPEO saying "Ok, do you want me to tell you what actually happened?" TPEO said yes and he wasn't prepared for what the owner of crafting table was about to say. "Blaze (blaze_wolf11) pushed your pig into lava while you're wifi cut out". TPEO was absolutely pissed and made sure to show the owner of crafting table that he was. The owner of crafting table made a statue of blaze_wolf11 burning and TPEO was happy to help with it.</p>
      <p>After the statue was made, The owner of crafting table wanted to make a place where pig killing wasn't allowed and people didn't use pigs as livestock. They made an area in crafting table called "The Pig Empire". A month later, TPEO said "We should make an entire server dedicated to just that".</p>
      <h1>What happened after the server was created?</h1>
      <p>TPEO made the server, then gave the owner of crafting table (which will now be known as the co-owner of TPE) co-owner permissions.</p>
      <p>TPEO and the co-owner of TPE just planned it as a small server with some basic plugins, little did they know, that was soon to change.</p>
      <h2>The backstory will not be continued as the server has sadly shut down</h2>
